# Coop 🐔

A personal agent gateway built in Rust.

Coop manages AI agents that live on your machine — routing messages from channels to agent sessions, enforcing trust-based access control, persisting conversations, and running background work. The agent runtime is powered by [Goose](https://github.com/block/goose).

**Status:** Design phase. See `docs/` for architecture and plans.
